# HybridOS

HybridOS is a totally new open source operating system designed for smart IoT devices and 
cloud computing environment.

HybridOS tries to provide the developers with more possibilities than just a
traditional operating system for a stand-alone hardware environment.

HybridOS not only runs on smart IoT devices to support application development
on devices, it also provides programming interfaces for the cloud and client,
providing developers with a new complete software stack and protocol stack 
from device to cloud to the client.

## Why we design a new OS for IoT?

At present, when we want to develop an consumer IoT (Internet of Things) device, 
we need to build a software team which has five engineers at least due to 
the complex software stack and protocol stack of IoT computing environment:

* At least one firmware engineer who writes programs in C/C++ for the IoT device, which
  generally runs a RTOS or Linux.
* At least one server engineer who writes programs in PHP/Python for the cloud services.
* At least one front-end engineer who writes programs in JavaScript/CSS/HTML5 for webpages.
* At least two client-end engineers who write programs in Java, Objective C, or Swift
  for smart phones, which run Android or iOS.

In addition, for some devices which may use for business, we need one or two engineers
to write desktop apps in C/C++ for Windows or macOS.

Obviously, the development cost of an IoT device is very higher than a tranditional 
embedded device. We need a new operating system to simplify the software and protocol
stack of IoT, and reduce the development cost of the IoT devices and services.

Not only that, the popular cloud computing services we can get from AWS, Ali, or Huawei
are not dedicated for IoT applications. We have to develop some cloud services by ourselves
to implement some features for our IoT devices. Moreover, the security of an IoT service 
is being seriously challenged.

For example, with the development of IoT technologies, we can now use our own smart phone
to remotely control the home air conditioner or view the home camera in real time. 
We can even use the smart phone to remotely open our home door from the office.
However, have you ever thought about the issue: how your smart lock knows that the received
door open command is sent by you? Or, conversely, is the real-time monitoring screen that
you see on your smart phone generated by your own camera?

The reality is that any hacker who breaks into the cloud can easily remotely control 
all smart IoT devices connected to the cloud, including your smart door locks and cameras. 
The current IoT products, like traditional Internet applications, have not improved much 
in terms of security. The scenes that we can often see from spy war movies can still be 
easily performed in reality.

The blockchain technology may change this. The decentralized design of the blockchain
provides another way to enhance the security of IoT. HybridOS will try to use blockchain 
technologies to improve the security of IoT.

## Goals of HybridOS

### A simplified software stack

HybridOS will provide a new software stack for IoT applications.

We will provide a new and universal GUI framework for IoT devices and client apps.
The developers can write device GUI and client apps for Windows/macOS/Andriod/iOS
by using a HTML5 like markup language and JavaScript language. You can even use
the same framework in you webpages which are wrotten in standard HTML5.

By using HybridOS, the development cost of an IoT application will be reduced greatly!

### IoT-dedicated cloud computing services

HybridOS will integrates some clouding computing services which are dedicated IoT,
such as MQTT, and firmware upgrade.

HybridOS will also introduce the serverless technologies for the IoT cloud computing.
In this way, the developer can easily integret the existed cloud services by 
writting a simple script.

Moreover, HybridOS will try to provide a blockchain-based IoT security service.

HybridOS will provide a enhanced MQTT implementation for communication between things
and the identity authentication mechanism based on blockchain technology. 

### Rich connectivities

HybridOS will provide a variety of connectivity options for the IoT devices, 
including high-speed Wi-Fi (in the 2.4G/5G band), Bluetooth, 4G/LTE, NB-IoT, USB, 
and so on. 

## License

For device side and client side, HybridOS uses GPL v3.

For server side, HybridOS uses AGPL v3.

Note that HybridOS integrets many open source software, such as V8 JavaScript engine.
