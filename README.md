# HybridOS

HybridOS is a new, open source, Linux-based operating system designed for smart IoT devices.

HybridOS attempts to provide the developers with more possibilities than just a traditional
operating system for a stand-alone hardware environment.

## Why we need a new OS for IoT?

To achieve this goal, HybridRun introduces a totally new open source operating system for 
smart IoT devices, a Linux-based but non-Android operating system. We call this operating 
system HybridOS. HybridOS not only runs on smart IoT devices to support application 
development on devices, it also provides programming interfaces for the cloud and client, 
providing developers with a complete software stack and protocol stack from device to cloud to the client.

## Goal of HybridOS

The future is the world of the Internet of Things.

Now, with the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, we can use our own smartphone
to remotely control the home air conditioner or view the home camera in real time. We can even 
use the smart phone to remotely open our home door from the office.

On the other hand, the IoT devices we are currently seeing are often connected to your smartphone 
or router via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. In order to know the working status of the device, you must 
approach it and open an app on your phone. Bluetooth speed is too slow and limited, it is not 
suitable for transmitting a large amount of data, and the setting of Wi-Fi is very cumbersome
- it is obvious that many current IoT devices, when emphasizing the interconnection function of things, 
forgetting that human is the center of the interconnection of things.

So, a new IoT operating system should provide a variety of connectivity options for 
the Internet of Things, including high-speed Wi-Fi (in the 2.4G/5G band), Bluetooth, 4G/LTE, 
USB, and so on. 

HybridOS's device-side system is based on the Linux kernel, making full use of the Linux kernel ecosystem, reducing the difficulty of developing various drivers and the difficulty of supporting various protocol stacks, thus reducing development costs.
