# HybridOS

HybridOS is a totally new open source operating system designed for smart IoT devices and 
cloud computing environment.

HybridOS tries to provide the developers with more possibilities than just a
traditional operating system for a stand-alone hardware environment.

HybridOS not only runs on smart IoT devices to support application development
on devices, it also provides programming interfaces for the cloud and the client,
providing developers with a new complete software stack and protocol stack 
from device to cloud and client.

## Why we design a new OS for IoT?

At present, when we want to develop a consumer IoT (Internet of Things) device, 
we have to build a software team which has five engineers at least due to 
the complex software stack and protocol stack of IoT computing environment:

  * At least one firmware engineer who writes programs in C/C++ for the IoT device, which
    generally runs a RTOS or Linux.
  * At least one server engineer who writes programs in PHP/Python for the cloud services.
  * At least one front-end engineer who writes programs in JavaScript/CSS/HTML5 for webpages.
  * At least two client-end engineers who write programs in Java, Objective C, or Swift
    for smart phones, which run Android or iOS.

In addition, for some devices which is used for business, we need one or two engineers
to write desktop apps in C/C++ for Windows or macOS.

Obviously, the development cost of an IoT device is very higher than a tranditional 
embedded device. We need a new operating system to simplify the software and protocol
stack of IoT, and reduce the development cost of the IoT devices and services.

Not only that, the popular cloud computing services we can get from AWS, Ali, or Huawei
are not dedicated for IoT applications. We have to develop some cloud services by ourselves
to implement some features for our IoT devices. Moreover, the security of an IoT service 
is being seriously challenged.

For example, with the development of IoT technologies, we can now use our own smart phone
to remotely control the home air conditioner or view the home camera in real time. 
We can even use the smart phone to remotely open our home door from the office.
However, have you ever thought about the issue: how your smart lock knows that the received
door open command is sent by you? Or, conversely, is the real-time monitoring screen that
you see on your smart phone generated by your own camera?

The reality is that any hacker who breaks into the cloud can easily remotely control 
all IoT devices connected to the cloud, including your smart door locks and cameras. 
The current IoT products, like traditional Internet applications, have not improved much 
in terms of security. The scenes that we can often see from spy war movies can still be 
easily performed in reality.

The blockchain technology may change this. The decentralized design of the blockchain
provides another way to enhance the security of IoT. HybridOS will try to use the 
technologies to improve the security of IoT.

## Technical Terminologies

  * Device: The IoT device; For HybridOS, the device here refers to a smart
    device that has direct access to the Internet and with or without a display.
  * Device App: An app runs on a device, with or without GUI.
  * Client: A desktop computer, a smart phone, or a tablet.
  * Client App: An app runs on a client.

## Goals of HybridOS

### A simplified software stack

HybridOS provides a new software stack for smart IoT device:

  * A standard peripheral and task management interface based on hBus (an enhanced
    edition of uBus), such as networking management, sensor (like GPS and 
    gravity accelerometer) management, and USB interface management.

  * Runtime support environment for various networking and cloud computing services
    based on Python, such as MQTT, WebSocket, HTTP, streaming services, etc.

  * A new and universal app framework for IoT devices and client apps.
    The developers can write device GUI app and client apps for Windows, macOS, 
    Andriod, and iOS operating systems by using a set of extended HTML5 tags 
    and JavaScript language. You can even embedded your HybridOS app directly
    in your webpages which are wrotten in standard HTML5 by importing the HybridOS
    JavaScript library.

Finally, the application programming languages of HybridOS will be reduced to two: 
JavaScript for apps and Python for services. As a result, the development cost of 
an IoT application will be reduced greatly by using HybridOS.

### IoT-dedicated cloud computing services

HybridOS integrates some cloud computing services which are dedicated to IoT,
such as MQTT, identity authentication by client apps, and firmware upgrade.

HybridOS also introduces the serverless technologies for the IoT cloud computing.
In this way, the developer can easily integret the existed cloud services by 
writting a simple script in Python.

In the future, HybridOS will try to provide a blockchain-based IoT security service.  
HybridOS will provide an enhanced MQTT implementation for communication between things
and the identity authentication mechanism based on blockchain technology. 

### Rich connectivities

HybridOS will provide a variety of connectivity options for the IoT devices, 
including high-speed Wi-Fi (in the 2.4G/5G band), Bluetooth, 4G/LTE, NB-IoT, USB, 
and so on. 

HybridOS's device-side system is based on the Linux kernel, making full use of the
Linux kernel ecosystem, reducing the difficulty of developing various drivers and 
the difficulty of supporting various protocol stacks, thus reducing development costs.
