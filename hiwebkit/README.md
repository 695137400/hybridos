# hiWebKit

`hiWebKit`, a [WebKit] derivative, provides support for
[HybridOS View Markup Language], as well as the popular Web standards
and specifications such as HTML 5.x and CSS 3.

The name `hiWebKit` is an abbreviation for `Hybrid-WebKit`.

As an extension of WebKit, hiWebKit will support HVML ([HybridOS View
Markup Language]) and HTML at the same time.

Therefore, hiWebKit not only supports HVML, but also is a great web engine.

## Building

Currently, we are developing the MiniGUI port.

Please stay tuned.
